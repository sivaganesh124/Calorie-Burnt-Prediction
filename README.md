# Calorie-Burnt-Prediction
Calories Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting calorie consumption using various machine learning regression models. It utilizes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation techniques to determine the best-performing model for accurate calorie predictions.

🔍 Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.

Model Implementation:

Linear Regression (Ridge, Lasso)

Decision Tree & Random Forest

Gradient Boosting & XGBoost

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE, R² Score, and MAE to compare model performance.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used (calories.csv) contains various features related to calorie expenditure.

Features include physical activity data, which influence calorie consumption.
